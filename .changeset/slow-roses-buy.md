'scoobie': major

Scoobie no longer supports MDX rendering, and so many pieces of this library have been removed.

Updating SEEK-internal codebases to use MDX v2/v3 has turned out to be challenging, and made even more challenging with the abstraction of having to do it via Scoobie.

This change returns Scoobie to be a React component library only.
